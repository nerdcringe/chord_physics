# chord_physics
A little Pygame application that makes it easy to play chords and experiment with music theory.
I gave it sliders and toggles to control the key, octave, chord, and more settings.

For fun, I tried it out using different waveforms

After making this, I started making a physical model with an Arduino. See it here! https://github.com/nerdcringe/arduino-chord-player.
